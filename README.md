# XGBoost_Allstate
2017 Exploration of Feature Engineering and XGBoost

The dataset for this exploration is from the Allstate Claims Severity Competition, and it can be downloaded to the same page as the notebook file in order to run the models. The train.csv dataset is used to extract test data for model development, so you will only need train.csv: https://www.kaggle.com/c/allstate-claims-severity/data
